<h1>The Best Movies According to Nonboy</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
    <h3>THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI</h3>
     <p>The film is a beautifully lyrical portrayal of the life of a clumsy yet single-minded samurai.</p>
    <h3>LAPUTA: Castle in the Sky</h3>
     <p>One of my favorite animated films, it is a magnificent adventure set in the vast sky, filled with laughter, tears, and thrills, stirring the hearts of boys and girls alike.</p>
    <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
     <p>I am simply amazed and moved by the indomitable spirit. Morgan Freeman's presence is also remarkable</p>
